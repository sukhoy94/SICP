Each programming language has:
 
1. primitive expressions (for example numbers)
2. means of combination, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones
3. means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.


Expressions representing numbers may be combined with an expression representing a primitive
procedure (such as + or *) to form a compound expression that represents the application of the
procedure to those numbers.

(+ 137 349) => 486
(- 1000 334) => 666
